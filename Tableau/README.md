## Description
In this module, we explored **Tableau**, a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool that enables users to create in-depth and interactive visualizations. The focus of the module was to learn how to load, clean, explore, and visualize data using Tableau, culminating in a hands-on mini-project where we designed dashboards and analyzed datasets to uncover unexpected phenomena.

## Features

1. **Analysis of CitiBike Data**:
   - Analyzed total trips during March, April, and May
   - How was it affected by the Covid-19 pandemic
   - Changes in member and non-member usage

2. **Interactive Map**:
   - Shows top stations across New York City
   - Increases in trips help populate most popular stations
   - 4 of the top 10 are located in Central Park

## Results

The culminating project involved analyzing data from Citi Bike Trip History Logs to uncover two unexpected phenomena. Key tasks included:
1. **Exploratory Analysis:**
   - Aggregating data to answer questions such as total trips recorded, ridership growth, and peak hours for bike usage in different seasons.
   - Investigating user types (e.g., short-term customers vs. annual subscribers) and their behaviors.

2. **Visualizations:**
   - Creating 4â€“10 visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line charts, and heatmaps) to analyze each phenomenon.
   - Designing dashboards to present trends and insights for city officials.

3. **Mapping:**
   - Developing either:
     - A static map displaying bike stations and their popularity with zip code overlays.
     - A dynamic map showing station popularity trends over time.

4. **Dashboard Design:**
   - Combining visualizations into cohesive dashboards with accompanying explanations to highlight insights for city officials.

5. **Presentation:**
   - Preparing a Tableau story to summarize visualizations and findings.
   - Ensuring all elements were professional, visually appealing, and easy to understand for non-analyst stakeholders.

## Key Takeaways
By the end of the module, participants gained hands-on experience with:
- Importing, cleaning, and exploring datasets in Tableau.
- Designing compelling visualizations and dashboards.
- Applying advanced techniques like LOD calculations, custom calculations, and mapping.
- Presenting data-driven insights effectively to non-technical audiences.

This module provided the skills needed to create meaningful visualizations that not only tell a story but also drive actionable insights for decision-makers.
